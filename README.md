# shiny-spoon
3-CNF-SAT (toy) solver

Uses a recursive procedure to try and find a satisfying assignment.

Now will require the **SymPy** Python package installed (pip install --user sympy)

The repository name was a GitHub suggestion.

There might be an upcoming Rust version (of parts of this repo) which will be called, naturally, rusty-spoon. That name I figured out myself.
Just to brush up on Rust a little bit.
